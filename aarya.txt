Vaish bruh, you're one of the most brilliant people I've ever met. Be it explaining Quantum Physics concepts or lifting our morales, you were always there for us. I admire you so much for being so dedicated and passionate. You're awesome, stay the same. I hope you remain happy always, with no uncertainity whatsoever :p. Jokes apart, I hope you have a rocking year ahead! College khu jaayein bas jaldi se so that I get to meet you soon <3
